# 16-811
Assignments for Computer Vision (16-811) @CMU

All the assignments are solved using MATLAB (R2081_a) or Python 3.6.5 (Anaconda Distribution). 

If you are currently taking the 16-811 course, I encourage you to try the assignments on your own and preferably not use the code snippets here - since this is a violation of the academic integrity policy of the institute.  

If you are here for learning different concepts, please go ahead and refer any snippets that you may not understand.
