Assignments for Computer Vision (16-720B) @CMU  All the assignments are solved using Python 3.6.5 (Anaconda Distribution) If you are currently taking the 16-720B course, I encourage you to try the assignments on your own and preferably not use the code snippets here - since this is a huge violation of the Academic Integrity Policy of the institute.  If you are here for learning different concepts, please go ahead and refer any snippets that you may not understand.
